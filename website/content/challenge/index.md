## The Challenge

In partnership with [The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders](https://www.aiepilepsy-neuro.com/) (2025), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/), [ETH](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/) and partners have organized a [seizure detection challenge]({{< ref "/challenge-description" >}}).

A detailed description of the challenge is presented [here]({{< ref "/challenge-description" >}}).

The challenge run from December 2024 to February 2024, totalling **30 algorithms** from **19 teams**. All algorithms were evaluated on the **[TODO]** dataset which remained private during the challenge. 

## Event-based Scoring
For all algorithms we evaluted the [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) (%), [Sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) (%), [Precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) (%) and the number daily [false positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives).
