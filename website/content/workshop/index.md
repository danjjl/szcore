title: "Reproducibility Workshop"
description: "A workshop aimed at investigating the reproducibility of seizure detection models."
---

We have all faced reproducibility challenges in machine learning, particularly when applying complex models like those used for epileptic seizure detection. You read an intriguing paper or model description, eagerly anticipating the release of source code and datasets, but then, either the resources are incomplete or outdated or, worse, they simply don't work. This is not only frustrating but also limits progress in the field, particularly when it comes to applying machine learning algorithms in real-world clinical settings, like epilepsy monitoring units.

In this workshop, we want to investigate this issue by investigating the reproducibility of algorithms used in epileptic seizure detection. The results will help assess the current state of reproducibility within this area of research and uncover common pitfalls faced when attempting to replicate results.

While reproducibility in research can be ensured without code if detailed methodology is provided, the availability of well-documented code plays a critical role in ensuring others can reproduce the results efficiently. We'll explore how to assess reproducibility better, improve accountability, and foster best practices in sharing code and data.

## Reproducibility workshop

The workshop will focus on algorithms for automated patient-independent seizure detection algorithms that have been published in the last five years (>2020) and that have source code accompanying their publication.

We aim to investigate the following:

1. **Stage 0 (Data Extraction):** Review all patient-independent seizure detection algorithms published in the last five years, focusing on papers that make models or source code publicly available. We will exclude papers that train models on private data that prohibit reproduction. We will investigate whether these models or codes are easy to run or reproduce.
2. **Stage 1 (Reproducibility Hackathon):** This hands-on hybrid hackathon will bring together researchers, students, and industry professionals to reproduce the results of a few selected seizure detection models. Participants will work on reproducing a subset of models, evaluating how easy it is to implement and whether any obstacles arise.
3. **Stage 2 (Scalable Reproducibility and Retraining):** This stage will follow up on the workshop by retraining models on larger datasets or combinations of datasets that were not tested in the original publication. The goal is to highlight the importance of training data in the seizure detection challenge.

## Why

The impact of this project is far-reaching:

- **Highlight strengths and weaknesses** of seizure detection models regarding reproducibility.
- **Identify best practices** for code and data sharing to improve reproducibility and foster accountability.
- **Encourage transparency** in machine learning research, enabling clinical adoption of seizure detection algorithms.
- **Offer students and early career researchers** a hands-on opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research and contribute to the community’s understanding of reproducibility in machine learning models.
- And most importantly: **It will be fun and educational**!
