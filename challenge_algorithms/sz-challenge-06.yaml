  The EEG seizure detection algorithm is based on Random Forest Model. The model leverages 
  a combination of statistical, spectral, and entropy-based features extracted from 
  multi-channel EEG signals. Time-domain features include mean, variance, skewness, and 
  kurtosis, while frequency-domain features are derived from Power Spectral Density (PSD)
  using Welch’s method. Additionally, entropy-based measures such as sample entropy and 
  fuzzy entropy enhance the model’s ability to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure
  patterns. EEG signals are processed using a 2-second sliding window with 50% overlap, 
  which are the same as the provided gotman1982 algorithm. The classification model 
  consists of a Random Forest Classifier with 20 decision trees (n_estimators=20), 
  utilizing class weighting (class_weight='balanced') to address class imbalance, and a 
  fixed random seed (random_state=0). After applying the seizure detection model, the 
  predictions might contain false positives, isolated short seizure detections, or closely
  spaced events, so nearby seizure events that occur within a short time gap are merged, 
  and very short detections (e.g., less than 2 seconds) are removed to reduce false 
  positives.

  The BIDS CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database were used for training and testing, using 80% of the 
  data for training and 20% for testing. So the sampling frequency is 256 Hz, and number of 
  channels is 18. Since the input data has 19 channel, one of the channel 'T3' will be 
  deleted to ensure the features of the model are matched. Before feature extraction, 
  the EEG signals undergo bandpass filtering (1–50 Hz), which is same as the provided 
  gotman algorithm. 

  The performance evaluation is based on a binary classification problem, where Class 0 
  (Non-Seizure); Class 1 (Seizure). The overall accuracy is 99%, because this is largely 
  influenced by the high number of non-seizure (Class 0) samples. Precision is 95% for 
  seizures, F1 score is 0.8 on the test set. 

  The EEG seizure detection algorithm consists of feature extraction and classification. 
  The algorithm processes EEG data using a 2-second sliding window with 50% overlap. 
  Welch’s Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation is used to extract frequency-domain 
  features, which has a complexity of O(N log N) for each window, where N is the number
  of EEG samples in the window. Other time-domain features (mean, variance, skewness, 
  kurtosis, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy) are computed in O(N) time. Given W sliding 
  windows, the total feature extraction complexity is O(W * N log N). The classification 
  is performed using a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) with 20 estimators, so the 
  classification complexity is (N trees × log features) per window."

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
