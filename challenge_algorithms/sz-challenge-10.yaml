  The channel-adaptive EEG architecture (CA-EEGWaveNet here) seamlessly processes any 
  multi-variate signal with an arbitrary number of channels. It uses three components: 
  the Encoder, that extracts short-term temporal information; the Fusion, that 
  reconstructs the spatial information; and the Memory, that processes long-term 
  dependencies to create a longer effective context window. As the Encoder, we use 
  EEGWaveNet. For the Fusion, we use an HRR-based composition. Finally, for the Memory,
  we use a TCN. The (i)EEG recording is divided into windows in the order of a few seconds. 
  These windows are processed by the Encoder channel-by-channel, to generalize to arbitrary 
  channel configurations. Then, the relationship between the channels is learned through 
  the Fusion component as geometric closeness between key vectors, that are then bound 
  with the feature vectors and bundled to obtain a single vector per window. This vector 
  contains both the spatial information and the short-term temporal information. Multiple 
  vectors are accumulated into a memory and finally processed by a TCN to get the final 
  classification results on a longer context window, in the order of a few minutes.

  All recordings are up-/or down-sampled to 256Hz for consistency with the testing dataset, 
  but 512Hz or higher have also been used successfully. Given the homogeneous nature of 
  the 10-20 system, the Fusion component is used without learning and a uniform 
  relationship is assumed across all channels. Nonetheless, any number of channels can be 
  used, with a linear increase in computational complexity. In particular, we use the 
  CHB-MIT and Siena datasets for training, and the TUSZ dataset for validation and 
  hyperparameter optimization. Except for sampling rate manipulation when needed, no other 
  pre-processing step is performed.

  We perform large-scale validation on iEEG datasets, that better represent the final 
  use-case of CA-EEGWaveNet. We compare CA-EEGWaveNet with EEGWaveNet on the Short-term 
  SWEC iEEG datset. CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, 
  while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the 
  baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76).

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).

            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
