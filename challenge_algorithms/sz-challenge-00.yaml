  We submit the DynaSD seizure detection algorithm for the AI in Epilepsy seizure detection competition. This algorithm leverages multivariate autoregressive loss for unsupervised seizure detection. We first train a deep autoregressive model on the beginning of each continuous EEG clip to learn baseline neural dynamics. The model is then deployed on 1-second windows with 0.5-second overlap, averaging the prediction error within each clip. Seizure detection is based on a threshold optimized on annotated intracranial EEG recordings. We tuned the following processing hyperparameters using a subset of the CHB-MIT dataset. Preprocessing includes bipolar re-referencing, normalizing the signal to the model training period, notch filtering at 60 and 120 Hz, bandpass filtering from 1 to 100 Hz, and downsampling to 128 Hz. After thresholding, we apply a 15-second temporal smoothing procedure to reduce false positives from artifacts and epileptiform spikes. A window is classified as seizure activity only if at least 9 channels (more than half) are detected as seizing.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
