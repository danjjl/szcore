  We submit the DynaSD (Dynamic Seizure Detection) seizure detection algorithm for 
  the AI in Epilepsy seizure detection competition. This algorithm uses autoregressive 
  loss as a seizure detection feature. We use a 12th order multivariate autoregressive 
  LSTM with a 10-element hidden state shared across all channels that is then fed through 
  a fully connected layer. In each clip, we assume that the first 60 seconds of the 
  clip will not contain a seizure or an abundance of ictal activity and can approximate
  patient and channel specific baseline neurophysiology. We train the LSTM to minimize 
  autoregressive mean squared error using the default adam optimizer parameters from 
  pytorch on the 60-second baseline period. We then deploy the algorithm on 1 second 
  windows with 0.5 seconds of overlap and average the mean absolute error within each 
  clip. We then threshold each window based on the average optimal threshold for 
  annotating seizure onset channels in a cohort of annotated intracranial EEG seizure 
  recordings.  We then applied a 5-second moving median window followed by a temporal 
  smoothing procedure where, for each window, 14 seconds of the following 15 seconds 
  must also be classified as seizure activity. Using this temporally smoothed signal, 
  we required that at least 9 (more than half) of the channels be detected as seizing 
  for a window to be classified as seizure activity. Prior to training and detection, 
  we bipolar re reference the signal, applied a notch filter at 60 and 120 Hz, bandpass 
  filtered the signal from 1 to 100 Hz, and then downsampled the signal to 128 Hz. We 
  tuned the filter frequencies, spatial and temporal smoothing parameters, and the 
  training sample size hyperparameters using the first 5 patients of the CHB-MIT scalp 
  dataset. We achieved a median (25th and 75th percentile) F1 score of 1.0 (0.58,1.0) 
  on this limited dataset. We do not report any space, time, or sample complexity for 
  our model, however, we did observe that running inference on one, 1-hour clip takes 
  approximately 15 seconds on an M1 Pro silicone chip with 10 CPU and 16 GPU cores and 
  32 GB of unified RAM.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
