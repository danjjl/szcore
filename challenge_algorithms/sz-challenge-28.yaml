abstract: >
  The seizure detection algorithm utilizes data from CHB-MIT to train, validate and 
  test the model. Specifically, the EEG data are first preprocessed according to the 
  BIDS format; then the time, frequency and wavelet domain features of the EEG data 
  are extracted; finally, these features are input into the TCN_GRU model for seizure 
  detection. The training EPOCH is 100, 3-fold cross-validation is performed, and the 
  average result of the 3-folds is taken as the result of this model. The training and 
  validation losses were printed for each fold to determine if the loss decreased 
  normally during training and to rule out overfitting. In addition, a post-processing 
  step was added to define epileptic events and Kalman filter the model output before 
  defining the events.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
