  Seizure detection using convolutional neural network: 
  The data is prepared from MIT Physionet database, where EEG was acquired at 256hz 
  frequency. A total of 198 seizures detected were used for the development of the 
  algorithm. The input data was created from each channel in the EEG data, excluding 
  some of the non-scalp EEG data.  The data was preprocessed for normalization and 
  filtered for 1- 45 hz frequency. 

  The training data was passed into 10 seconds data from each electrode with a sliding
  window step. 

  The algorithm was yielding an F1 value of 0.8 to 0.9 on individual channel inputs 
  and a seizure prediction accuracy of 90-100 % when all channels considered. 

  The time taken to analyze 10 minutes of data from a standard EEG montage 
  (256 hz sampling frequency) was approximately 120 seconds.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
