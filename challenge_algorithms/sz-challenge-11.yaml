abstract: >
  We introduce a novel deep-learning architecture for simultaneous seizure detection that 
  departs from traditional window-level classification methods. Instead of assigning a 
  single label to segmented windows, our approach utilizes a deep encoder, comprising 
  1D convolutions, Network-in-Network modules, residual connections, and a transformer 
  encoder with global attention, to process raw EEG signals in the time domain. This 
  design produces high-level representations that capture rich temporal dependencies at 
  each time step. A streamlined decoder then converts these features into a sequence of 
  probabilities, directly indicating the presence or absence of seizures at every time 
  step. By operating at the time-step level, our method avoids the need for complex 
  post-processing to map window labels to events and eliminates redundant overlapping 
  inferences, thereby enhancing the model’s efficiency and accuracy. Extensive 
  experiments on a public EEG seizure detection dataset demonstrate that our model 
  significantly outperforms existing approaches, underscoring its potential for real-time, 
  precise seizure detection.

            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
