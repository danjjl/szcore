  Introduction
  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurring, unprovoked seizures. 
  Recently, deep learning has offered a unique approach to reliable seizure detection 
  by capturing latent patterns in EEG data in order to accurately predict seizure onset 
  and duration. However, automatic seizure detection is still challenging due to high 
  inter-subject variability, which limits model performance. We present DeepSOZ-HEM, a 
  robust deep learning framework specifically designed for high-resolution seizure 
  detection from multichannel scalp EEG, offering strong generalizability across 
  multiple datasets.

  Methods
  Building upon our original DeepSOZ model (M. Shama, et al.), DeepSOZ-HEM leverages a 
  transformer encoder to extract both global and channel-wise features from EEG, which 
  are subsequently integrated via an LSTM module to capture temporal dynamics at a 
  second-level resolution. The model is configured to accept inputs sampled at a 
  frequency of 256 Hz and featuring 19 channels from average-referenced data. We 
  preprocessed data by splitting all recordings into 10-minute segments with 2 minutes 
  of overlap between each segment of the recording, zero-padding when necessary. To 
  postprocess the model’s predictions, we implemented a moving average (25-second) 
  kernel that smoothed the outputs and stitched outputs from multiple segments of a 
  recording before converting them into a BIDS-compatible format. We trained DeepSOZ-HEM 
  using 10-fold cross-validation on a large cohort of 171 patients from the Temple 
  University Hospital (TUH) corpus. To further enhance detection performance, we 
  employed a hard example mining (HEM) strategy that iteratively retrains the model on 
  selected EEG recordings containing heightened false positives and missed detections 
  from the initial training phase on the TUH dataset. We chose to exclude CHB-MIT 
  dataset as it is not average-referenced. Finally, the HEM process is complemented by 
  additional training and validation on 14 patients from the University of Siena Scalp 
  EEG Database for improved robustness and generalization. 

  Results
  After the initial 10-fold training stage, we observed an average F1 score of 
  0.62 土 0.11 across folds.  The best performing model split featured an F1 score of 
  0.76. After retraining this model using the HEM strategy, we observed an event-based 
  F1 score of 0.89 on the TUH validation set, indicating that the HEM strategy improved 
  model performance. We also observed an event-based F1 score of 0.72 on the Siena 
  dataset, indicating high generalizability. The Siena dataset featured a slight drop 
  in performance due to its large amount of long EEG recordings (12 hours or more) 
  with almost exclusively background noise, leading to some inevitable false positives.

  Significance
  Based on the event-based metrics for F1 score, DeepSOZ-HEM indicates high potential 
  for success in future clinical applications. This approach offers a reliable seizure 
  detection algorithm that can be integrated into clinical workflows, especially due to 
  its ability to generalize well to patient variability. Future works may consider 
  retraining DeepSOZ’s onset zone localization branch and confidence scoring using HEM.

            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
