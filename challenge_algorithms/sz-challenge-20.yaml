  Objective: Finding events of interest is a common task in biomedical signal processing.
  The detection of epileptic seizures and signal artefacts are two key examples. 
  Epoch-based classification is the typical machine learning framework to detect such 
  signal events because of the straightforward application of classical machine learning 
  techniques. Usually, post-processing is required to achieve good performance and 
  enforce temporal dependencies. Designing the right post-processing scheme to convert 
  these classification outputs into events is a tedious, and labor-intensive element of 
  this framework. 
  
  Methods: We propose an event-based modeling framework that directly 
  works with events as learning targets, stepping away from ad-hoc post-processing 
  schemes to turn model outputs into events. We illustrate the practical power of this 
  framework on simulated data and real-world data, comparing it to epoch-based modeling 
  approaches. 
  
  Results: We show that event-based modeling (without tailored 
  post-processing) performs on par with or better than epoch-based modeling with 
  extensive post-processing. 
  
  Conclusion: These results show the power of treating events 
  as direct learning targets, instead of using ad-hoc post-processing to obtain them, 
  severely reducing design effort. Significance: The event-based modeling framework 
  can easily be applied to other event detection problems in signal processing, removing 
  the need for intensive task-specific post-processing. This model was trained on the 
  train and dev set of TUSZ v2.0.3.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 â€“ 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
