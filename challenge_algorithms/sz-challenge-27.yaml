  bRAWlstar: Linear Recurrent Unit for raw EEG processing

  We present bRAWlstar, a simple seizure detection model based on the Linear Recurrent 
  Unit, a linear state-space model for sequence processing. Raw EEG data is preprocessed 
  by removing the mean and bandstop filtering 60Hz. Then, the model—composed of multiple 
  LRU layers—receives the preprocessed EEG data (at 256Hz) and predicts timepoint-matched 
  seizure labels. Training is made efficient with parallel scan, and arbitrary-length 
  signal can be processed at inference time due to the recurrent nature of the LRU 
  layer. The model is trained on the Temple University Seizure Corpus, but only on runs 
  with seizures. Binary classification threshold is further tuned on the TUSZ dev set. 
  It achieved a subject-averaged F1 score of 0.29 on Siena and 0.45 on the TUSZ 
  evaluation dataset.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
