  Van Gogh Detect
  The proposed seizure detection model is a binary classification algorithm that 
  predicts for every 10s chunk of a record the probability that it belongs to a 
  seizure. It is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and 
  some transformer blocks.

  It takes as input a sequence of N chunks of 10s duration of EEG signals and it 
  predicts the binary label associated to the middle chunk, at the position N // 2 
  in the sequence. Label 0 means that the 10s chunk does not belong to a seizure, 
  label 1 means that the 10s chunk does belong to a seizure.

  The records predictions are then post processed, i.e. thresholded, to keep 
  predictions above a certain threshold. The remaining predictions are considered 
  to be the model predictions, from which one can extract the onset(s) and the 
  duration(s) of the predicted seizure(s).

  The model is trained and it predicts on 18 EEG derivations sampled at 256 Hz, 
  defined according to the double banana montage. Records with missing channels 
  were excluded. The model is trained on records from TUH, CHBMIT, SIENA and a 
  private source of data.

            This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
            consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
            intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
            days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
            characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
            surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
            and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
            females, ages 1.5–19).

          This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
          from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
          recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
          files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
          based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
          algorithms.
          V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
          duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
          (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
          and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
          Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
          They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
          The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
          stop, channel and seizure type.

          The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
          of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
          9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
          a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
          basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
          or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
          according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
          performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
          electrophysiological data of each patient.
