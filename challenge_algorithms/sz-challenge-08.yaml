  We present HySEIZa, a seizure detection model leveraging the Hyena hierarchy for 
  efficient long-range EEG processing. The model classifies 12-second EEG windows 
  into seizure and non-seizure states at 1 Hz resolution, processing all 19 EEG 
  channels with minimal preprocessing, including bandpass filtering (0.5–120 Hz) 
  and notch filtering (50 Hz and 60 Hz). EEG signals are transformed using a 
  short-term Fourier transform (STFT) with 1-second non-overlapping segments. 
  Input features are standardized per channel across the training set. During 
  inference, the model performs sliding-window predictions at 1-second increments, 
  and the final classification is obtained by averaging predictions over time. 
  We train and evaluate HySEIZa on the Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) 
  and, achieving a subject-averaged F1 score of 66.01.
