  Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures, 
  affecting approximately 50 million individuals globally. Given the potential severity 
  of the associated complications, early and accurate seizure detection is crucial. 
  In clinical practice, scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) are non-invasive tools widely 
  used in seizure detection and localization, aiding in the classification of seizure 
  types. However, manual EEG annotation is labor-intensive, costly, and suffers from low 
  inter-rater agreement, necessitating automated approaches. To address this, we 
  introduce a novel deep learning framework, combining a convolutional neural network 
  (CNN) module for temporal and spatial feature extraction from multi-channel EEG data, 
  and a transformer encoder module to capture long-term sequential information. We 
  conduct extensive experiments on a public EEG seizure detection dataset, achieving an 
  unweighted average F1 score of 0.731, precision of 0.724, and recall (sensitivity) 
  of 0.744. We further replicate several EEG analysis pipelines from literature and 
  demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms, current state-of-the-art approaches. 
  This work provides a significant step forward in automated seizure detection. By 
  enabling a more effective and efficient diagnostic tool, it has the potential to 
  significantly impact clinical practice, optimizing patient care and outcomes in 
  epilepsy treatment. This model was trained on TUH EEG Seizure Corpus v2.0.3.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 â€“ 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
