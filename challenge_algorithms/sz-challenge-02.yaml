  Rationale and Algorithm: Seizure detection on scalp EEG faces challenges due to poor 
  signal-to-noise ratio and heterogeneity in seizure patterns and localizations. We 
  developed a feature extraction algorithm that captures seizure-related changes across 
  various timescales and frequencies. Our approach combines linear, non-linear, and 
  connectivity features, and uses these as input into a Gradient Boosted Trees model 
  regularized by a  post-processing algorithm.
  
  Data Processing: EEGs were segmented into overlapping 10s windows (4s overlap) using 
  all 19 standard EEG channels in average referential montage. We applied the Continuous 
  Wavelet Transform with Morlet wavelets to decompose the signal into 8 frequency bands 
  (from 3 Hz to 50 Hz, one 3–40 Hz band). After frequency-dependent downsampling, we 
  extracted linear (band power), non-linear (fuzzy entropy and line length), and 
  connectivity features (including betweenness, efficiency, eigenvector centrality, node 
  strength) from the filtered signals. The scaled features were then processed through a
  machine learning pipeline combining minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance feature 
  selection and XGBoost classification. The epoch-based predictions were regularized 
  using the Firing Power algorithm, which consists in applying a moving average across
  $\tau$ segments and binarizing the results with a fixed threshold $T$.

  Training and Validation: The model was trained on a subset of the Temple University 
  Hospital and the Siena Hospital Seizure Detection datasets. We conducted an initial 
  feature exploration step through visual exploration of 1,507 EEGs (training set) to 
  narrow down the set of features and frequency bands. Hyperparameter selection was done 
  with a random search over a nested cross-validation (100 iterations, 5-fold inner loop, 
  3-fold outer loop). The criterion for the cross-validation was the epoch-wise F1-score. 
  The outer-loop predictions were used to select the optimal Firing Power’s $\tau$ and $T$
  values.

  Performance: We tested the best model on a held-out set of 453 EEGs from the same 
  datasets, without overlap between subjects. With a  of 12 and T of 0.4, the model 
  achieved an average event-based F1 score of 0.72 (precision = 0.34, sensitivity 0.30). 
  For the final submissions, we further optimized $\tau$ and $T$ on this held-out set.

  Complexity: Our optimized implementation employs frequency-domain convolutions and 
  channel-wise parallelization, achieving logarithmic-linear complexity with signal 
  length. Processing time averages 5 minutes per hour of EEG using 10 CPU cores and 50 
  GB RAM.

# List all datasets that were used to train this algorithm

    - title: "Siena Scalp EEG Database"

        - description: >
            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
