abstract: >
  We present S4Seizure, a simple seizure detection model based on a standard S4 
  backbone, segmenting 12-second EEG windows into seizure and nonseizure states at 
  a 1 Hz resolution. The model processes all 19 EEG channels with minimal preprocessing, 
  including bandpass filtering (0.5–120 Hz) and notch filtering (50 Hz and 60 Hz). 
  The EEG window is then transformed with a short-term Fourier-transform using 1-second 
  non-overlapping segments. We standardized input data per channel across the entire 
  training set. During inference, predictions are made in 1-second increments across a 
  recording, with the final classification obtained by averaging predictions over time. 
  We trained S4Seizure on the Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) and evaluated it 
  on the Siena Seizure Dataset (SSDD) and the TUSZ evaluation set.
  
  In this version of the model, the decision threshold was set to 0.85. Using this 
  setting, it  achieved a subject-averaged F1 score of 0.52 on SSDD and 0.69 on the 
  TUSZ evaluation dataset, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen data.
