  We present SeizFormer, a seizure detection model that combines convolutional and 
  transformer-based architectures to classify 12-second EEG windows into seizure and 
  non-seizure states. The model processes all 19 EEG channels with minimal preprocessing, 
  including bandpass filtering (0.5–120 Hz) and notch filtering (50 Hz and 60 Hz). EEG 
  signals are transformed using a short-term Fourier transform (STFT) with 1-second 
  non-overlapping segments. The convolutional encoder captures local temporal and spatial 
  features, while the transformer-based decoder models long-range dependencies for robust 
  classification. Input features are standardized per channel across the training set. 
  During inference, the model classifies each 12-second EEG window independently. We train 
  and evaluate SeizFormer on the Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) and, achieving a 
  subject-averaged F1 score of 54.65.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
