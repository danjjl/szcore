  In this work, we present a novel algorithm for seizure detection that integrates 
  transfer learning with AlexNet, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), and a module to 
  analyze long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Our approach addresses the 
  critical need for accurate and efficient seizure detection in clinical settings, where 
  timely intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes.

  The algorithm begins by applying HHT to decompose EEG signals into intrinsic mode 
  functions, effectively capturing the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics 
  inherent in seizure activity. These features are then processed using a pre-trained 
  AlexNet model, leveraging transfer learning to enhance detection performance. A module 
  is employed to refine the feature set, minimizing noise and improving signal 
  representation. Notably, our method utilizes a 1-second time sample window, striking 
  a balance between temporal resolution and computational efficiency.

  We evaluated our method using datasets collected from the Iranian Center of 
  Neurological Disorders and selected segments of the CHB-MIT dataset, focusing on 
  detecting both the onset and duration of seizures within continuous EEG recordings. 
  The CHB-MIT dataset is publicly available, while the data from our center can be 
  obtained upon request to Dr. Tafakhori or Dr. Saeedinia. The performance of our 
  algorithm is assessed using the event-based F1 score metric, demonstrating a 
  significant improvement in detection accuracy compared to traditional methods.

  This work not only contributes to advancing seizure detection technologies but also 
  aligns with the challenge's goal of developing robust models that can be deployed in 
  real-time clinical environments. Our findings indicate that combining deep learning 
  techniques with advanced signal processing methods can lead to effective solutions for 
  epilepsy monitoring.

  Furthermore, we conducted a complexity analysis of our algorithm, considering both 
  time and space complexity. The use of transfer learning with AlexNet reduces the
  computational burden typically associated with training deep neural networks from 
  scratch. The HHT decomposition, while computationally intensive, is offset by the 
  efficiency gained in subsequent processing steps. The 1-second window approach allows 
  for near real-time analysis, crucial for clinical applications. Overall, our method 
  achieves a favorable balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, 
  making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
