  Objective: Finding events of interest is a common task in biomedical signal 
  processing. The detection of epileptic seizures and signal artefacts are two 
  key examples. Epoch-based classification is the typical machine learning 
  framework to detect such signal events because of the straightforward 
  application of classical machine learning techniques. Usually, 
  post-processing is required to achieve good performance and enforce temporal 
  dependencies. Designing the right post-processing scheme to convert these 
  classification outputs into events is a tedious, and labor-intensive element 
  of this framework.
  Methods: We propose an event-based modeling framework that directly works 
  with events as learning targets, stepping away from ad-hoc post-processing 
  schemes to turn model outputs into events. We illustrate the practical power 
  of this framework on simulated data and real-world data, comparing it to 
  epoch-based modeling approaches.
  Results: We show that event-based modeling (without tailored post-processing) 
  performs on par with or better than epoch-based modeling with extensive 
  post-processing. 
  Conclusion: These results show the power of treating events as direct 
  learning targets, instead of using ad-hoc post-processing to obtain them, 
  severely reducing design effort.
  Significance: The event-based modeling framework can easily be applied to 
  other event detection problems in signal processing, removing the need for 
  intensive task-specific post-processing.
  This model was trained on the train and dev set of TUSZ v2.0.3.
