  Automated seizure detection and classification from electroencephalography
  (EEG) can greatly improve seizure diagnosis and treatment. However, several
  modeling challenges remain unaddressed in prior automated seizure detection
  and classification studies: (1) representing non-Euclidean data structure in EEGs,
  (2) accurately classifying rare seizure types, and (3) lacking a quantitative inter-
  pretability approach to measure model ability to localize seizures. In this study,
  we address these challenges by (1) representing the spatiotemporal dependencies
  in EEGs using a graph neural network (GNN) and proposing two EEG graph
  structures that capture the electrode geometry or dynamic brain connectivity, (2)
  proposing a self-supervised pre-training method that predicts preprocessed sig-
  nals for the next time period to further improve model performance, particu-
  larly on rare seizure types, and (3) proposing a quantitative model interpretabil-
  ity approach to assess a model's ability to localize seizures within EEGs. When
  evaluating our approach on seizure detection and classification on a large pub-
  lic dataset (5,499 EEGs), we find that our GNN with self-supervised pre-training
  achieves 0.875 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve on seizure
  detection and 0.749 weighted F1-score on seizure classification, outperforming
  previous methods for both seizure detection and classification. Moreover, our
  self-supervised pre-training strategy significantly improves classification of rare
  seizure types (e.g. 47 points increase in combined tonic seizure accuracy over
  baselines). Furthermore, quantitative interpretability analysis shows that our GNN
  with self-supervised pre-training precisely localizes 25.4% focal seizures, a 21.9
  point improvement over existing CNNs. Finally, by superimposing the identified
  seizure locations on both raw EEG signals and EEG graphs, our approach could
  provide clinicians with an intuitive visualization of localized seizure regions.
