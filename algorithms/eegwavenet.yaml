  The detection of seizures in epileptic patients via Electroencephalography 
  (EEG) is an essential key to medical treatment. With the advances in deep 
  learning, many approaches are proposed to tackle this problem. However, 
  concerns such as performance, speed, and subject-independency should still be 
  considered for practical application. Thus, we propose EEGWaveNet, a novel 
  end-to-end multiscale convolutional neural network designed to address 
  epileptic seizure detection. Our network utilizes trainable depth-wise 
  convolutions as discriminative filters to simultaneously gather features from 
  each EEG channel and separate the signal into multiscale resolution. Then, 
  the spatial-temporal features are extracted from each scale for further 
  classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EEGWaveNet, we evaluate 
  the model in three datasets: CHB-MIT, TUSZ, and BONN. From the results, 
  EEGWaveNet’s performance is comparable to other baseline methods in the 
  subject-dependent approach and outperforms the others in subject-independent 
  approaches. EEGWaveNet also has time complexity comparable to the compact 
  EEGNet-8,2. Moreover, we transfer the model trained from the 
  subject-independent approach and fine-tune it with a 1-h recording, 
  significantly improving sensitivity and F1-score (Binary) compared to without 
  fine-tuning. This article indicates the possibility of further developing 
  this model and the fine-tuning methodology toward healthcare 5.0, where the 
  AI aid clinicians in a manner of man–machine collaboration.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
