  Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurring 
  seizures, affecting approximately 50 million individuals globally. Given the 
  potential severity of the associated complications, early and accurate 
  seizure detection is crucial. In clinical practice, scalp 
  electroencephalograms (EEGs) are non-invasive tools widely used in seizure 
  detection and localization, aiding in the classification of seizure types. 
  However, manual EEG annotation is labor-intensive, costly, and suffers from 
  low inter-rater agreement, necessitating automated approaches. To address 
  this, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, combining a convolutional 
  neural network (CNN) module for temporal and spatial feature extraction from 
  multi-channel EEG data, and a transformer encoder module to capture long-term 
  sequential information. We conduct extensive experiments on a public EEG 
  seizure detection dataset, achieving an unweighted average F1 score of 0.731, 
  precision of 0.724, and recall (sensitivity) of 0.744. We further replicate 
  several EEG analysis pipelines from literature and demonstrate that our 
  pipeline outperforms, current state-of-the-art approaches. This work provides 
  a significant step forward in automated seizure detection. By enabling a more 
  effective and efficient diagnostic tool, it has the potential to 
  significantly impact clinical practice, optimizing patient care and outcomes 
  in epilepsy treatment.
