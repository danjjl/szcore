  Prolonged EEG monitoring in epilepsy can be optimized by selectively
  recording ictal and interictal activity. We present a deep
  neural network-based method for automatic seizure detection, independent
  of clinical signs. The model analyzes EEG signals to identify paroxysmal
  rhythmic bursts (3â€“20 Hz) by evaluating amplitude, duration, and rhythmicity.
  Evaluated on 24 surface and 44 intracerebral recordings, the approach detects
  diverse seizure types. The system enables real-time, multi-channel seizure
  and spike detection.
